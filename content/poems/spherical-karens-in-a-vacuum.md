Callous apathy faces tragedy

better than a tether

to a justly, mustly, moral weather.

When a raincoat will do you just fine,

as a cold equanimous outline

keeps your soul from the cold until the sun shines.

So cool your tantrums child,

my memories will not be defiled

by a _so certain_ insistence

that a love should be built on persistence.

_A rose by any other name is still perennial,_

#popper
In my most intimate relationships, I've found that an ebb and flow to the intensity is what feels natural. The always-on, catastrophic death march either to "together forever" or some irreperable tear in the relationship that ends it forever has always made me want to do something different.

Can't we let beautiful things die back year on year and then return? Like the roses that teach us so much of love?
::

it's not a fault of my milennial mind

that I don't want to flog a horse

when I watched it die.

But the bittersweet butterscotch kisses,

of a heart yearning for a love that it misses,

reminds me that a person is built from their wishes,

and the future is a blossom of these dishes

that I'm doing day and night you ungrateful scum...

you think my therapist is doing this for fun?

I'm not some object of your desires to be knelt on

because my face seemed to match the description

you once whispered to the boy fairy,

pulling out your teeth cause they weren't ready.

And I get it, I'm not good at this anger shit,

if I cut too close, I might hit truth

like some blind surgeon in a confession booth,

covered in bloody art...eries.

If gender is performative, and formative, 

::v-tooltip
_informative consent should form the basis of our graces to our heirs._

#popper
We are reshaping the standards of traditional gender roles over time through how we act, and how we act informs who we are and are becoming.

It's important to me that we center individual desire and nuance above even subversive gender roles, so we never trap people by assuming what they like.

I flip the "airs and graces", with which we normally bludgeon progress, to emphasize how should rather let our younger generations show us what else is possible. 

Also alluding to "informed consent" which is reshaping the standards of ethical sexuality.
::

We're all holding aces we can't show

because the air's so stagnant no-one dares to breathe

lest they know that we're still living.

But I don't have the answers man,

I'm just living heart to hands,

I mean, I can't even solve problems with the people I love.

-------

So how can we have compassion then,

for a tyrant who's fashion sense

is built on 1940's Machiavellian catastrophy?

A banal and Orwellian blasphemy,

::v-tooltip
_as the Jewish class of '25 sees the one-way mirror from the other side._

#popper
The most canonical example of an oppressed people is now playing out the role of the oppressor. I try to conjure an image of teaching our kids about this in schools years from now.
::

And the bulk of the peace-loving nations,

those slow-moving crustaceans,

sit and watch their friends take a beating.

What is this I'm eating?

It tastes like dopamine,

as the phone-screen fiend that lurks within wonders who it can trust.

You were supposed to save us Elon Musk!

------

Well isn't there some transcendental stance?

From the optimist apothecary's next advance?

To put me in a trite robotically perfect dance,

grinding out enlightenment, one foot before the last?

::v-tooltip
_Is this one-ness I'm feeling a Cooper-pairing in the lattice of human inter-subjectivity?_

#popper
At superconducting temperatures, normally repelling electrons pair up through interaction with the metal they flow through to overcome any resistance. 

Flow state feels similar to this, and every interaction with others feels like it's supporting you towards your goals. This is especially where we develop our sense of self together with the people we are closest with.
::

Can we somehow sense,

not the contents of each others' thoughts,

but the musicality of their intentions?

Does the passion in our faces and the movements in our bodies

betray a rhythm that we recognise?

::v-tooltip
_Like cuttlefish catching feelings._

#popper
Cuttlefish use their skin as screens to literally display their emotions on their bodies. If you really tune into trying to sense what someone's thinking by looking at them, it's almost as if we can do the same.
::

And by that, do the fluid forces of empathy and herd intelligence

move to corral our better natures based on

some primordial urge for togetherness and for out betterment?

------

In the name of the Mother,

her Daughter

and their Trans-Femme Ally,

I bless thee.

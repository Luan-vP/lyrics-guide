Honoured cousins,

Let us pack up, and at the sun up go down together,

Seeking not warmer weather, but cooler climbs,

And soaring heights to match our wild virtues.

We seek unity, not in uniformity, but in our uniqueness.

A palace of self-expression built on nurturing the parts whose sum, the whole surpasses.

And what need have we for chains when our common threads bind us more tightly

than hammered steel ever could.

An umbilical chord plays in unison throughout mankind.

Where the individual stands sovereign is where we must rebuild the republic.

_And on the seven hills of inner harmony, a true Rome may rise,_

Rome was built on top of 7 hills, and there are 7 chakras in the body

when at the breasts of wolves,

::v-tooltip
_we've learned to be wild once more._

Romulus and Remus were the mythical founders of Rome, raised by a wolf mother when they were abandoned as babies.
